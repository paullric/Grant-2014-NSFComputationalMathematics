\section{Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources}

Over the course of this project computational resources for software development, testing and data analysis will be required.  Several avenues for obtaining computational resources are available to the PI, which will be pursued to ensure the success of this work.

\paragraph{University of California, Davis:} The University of California, Davis has recently invested in building a campus-wide computing cluster for the advancement of scientific research in the environmental sciences, of which a significant portion was provided as part of the PI's start-up package.  Consequently the PI and his research team will have high-priority access to this cluster, with over 1,500 processors, including full-time technical support from the campus computing team.  Laptops for the postdoctoral researcher and graduate student researcher are also provided by the PI's start-up package.

\paragraph{NSF and DoE Supercomputing Facilities:}  Through his connections with Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the PI has access to computational resources at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), specifically on the Department of Energy Hopper supercomputing system.  Further, if this project is awarded, the PI will apply for additional computational resources from the Department of Energy and on the Yellowstone supercomputing system.
